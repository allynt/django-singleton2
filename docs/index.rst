   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Django Singleton2's documentation!
=============================================

.. note::
  This is a silly little Django Reusable App which can be used purely as a guide for writing *other* Django Resuable Apps.

  Feel free to use the actual - *it is useful* - but mostly this repository exists to document the process of professionaly creating a Django Reusable App.  I use the word "professionaly" to distinguish it from just writing Python code that does clever stuff in Django.  This repository also includes automated documentation, testing, and publishing.  All the stuff that all those other "professional" apps have but which don't ever seem to be documented anywhere.
