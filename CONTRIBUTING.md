# Introduction

### Welcome to django-singleton2

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, I will reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What types of contributions are accepted?

*Anything really.*

Although I'm not really bothered about the application code itself.  

Don't get me wrong - I *do* use it in production code, but the main purpose of this repository is to learn and teach best practices for developing a Django Reusable App.  Therefore, what I'm mostly looking for are suggestions to the tools and processes I recommend in README.md

# Getting started

### How to submit a contribution

1. create a branch
2. code - test - repeat
3. create a PR based on that branch
4. wait for Code Review
5. merge into master
