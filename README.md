~~~
This is a silly little Django Reusable App which can be used purely as a guide for writing *other* Django Resuable Apps.

Feel free to use the actual code - *it is useful* - but mostly this repository exists to document the process of professionaly creating a Django Reusable App.  I use the word "professionaly" to distinguish it from just writing Python code that does clever stuff in Django.  This repository also includes automated documentation, testing, and publishing.  All the stuff that all those other "professional" apps have but which don't ever seem to be documented anywhere.
~~~
## The app

A singleton is a class that can only be instanciated a single time.  `SingletonMixin` turns any Django Model into a singleton.  

### Installation

Install with pip.

```
pip install django-singleton2
```

_or_

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ django-singleton2
```

Add _singleton2_ to your _INSTALLED_APPS_

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...
  'singleton2',
]
```

### Configuration

Update _settings.py_ if you feel like it:

```
SINGLETON_RAISE_ERROR_ON_SAVE = True|False
```

The default value is False.

### Usage

```
from django.db import models
from singleton2.models import SingletonMixin

class MySingletonModel(SingletonMixin, models.Model):
  pass

my_singleton_instance = MySingletonModel.load()
```

Validation errors will ocurr if you try to save more than one instance of a singleton via a form (such as in the Django Admin).  These will be handled by normal Django form processing.  

If you try to save more than one instance of a singleton outside of a form then nothing will happen, unless `SINGLETON_RAISE_ERROR_ON_SAVE` is set to True in which case an exception will be raised.


> **Note** that the app is called "django-singleton2" because there is an existing [django-singleton](https://github.com/defbyte/django-singleton) app which works perfectly well.  

-----

## The process of creating the app

All the stuff that other people seem to already know is described here.

I do all of my coding on Ubuntu because I'm not insane.  

### project structure (part 1)

First create the repository in GiHub.  In theory this can be done from the command line using (gh)[https://cli.github.com/], but honestly, I find using the GitHub website a lot more straightforward.  Plus doing it this way can automatically create the README.md, LICENSE, and .gitignore files.  

Once that has been done, clone the repository into your local filesystem and then setup the basic directory structure:

`git clone git@github.com:allynt/django-singleton2.git django-singleton`
`mkdir -p django-singleton/singleton`
`mkdir -p django-singleton/example-project`
`mkdir -p django-singleton/docs`
`mkdir -p django-singleton/.github`
`cd django-singleton/`

This provides us with a place to store the app, a project to develop against, documentation, and workflows for CI.

Since you're using github, now would be as good a time as any to create some templates to help potential collaborators.  I AM HERE

Now that that's all out of the way run

`git add .`
`git commit -m "initial commit"`
`git push`

to make sure that github and your local filesystem are in sync.

### setup a sensible environment (part 1)

In order to develop code efficiently I use some standard python tooling.

### pyenv

I use pyenv to manage my Python versions.

To install pyenv first make sure the dependencies are installed:
```
$ sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl
```

Then install pyenv itself:
```
$ curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

and add the following to "~/.bashrc":
```
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

Reload the shell and install your favorite versions of python.  Then instruct pyenv which version to use in the repository; I'm using 3.10.0 at the time of writing.

`pyenv local 3.10.0`

This should create a "django-singleton/.python-version" file.

#### poetry

Python package managment is hard.  There is also no one standard way of doing it.  Like most developers, I started with pip and migrated to pipenv and toyed with piptools and embraced poetry.  Poetry handles virtual environments and package dependency management as well as building and publishing code.  To install it simply run:

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry self update
poetry completions bash >> ~/.bash_completion
```

Note that the resultant completions file doesnâ€™t work in all versions of bash; multiword case statements have to be encased in quotes.

Next setup some config:

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`
```

This ensures that all virtual environments will be located in the project directory in a directory called ".venv".  This is very useful for integrating your virtual environments with your IDEs as we'll see later on.

From here on, when I instruct you to install a specific python package you should use poetry to be doing this.  All the installed packages will be recorded in a "pyproject.toml" file.  As you develop it is a good idea to generate a "poetry.lock" file that locks all dependencies to a specific version.  I would say that this is essential when developing a Django Project but not when developing a Django Reusable App.  Anybody that uses it will incorporate it into their own "poetry.lock" file.  And, anyway, tox will reinstall dependencies during testing.  

Don't forget to run `poetry install` to create your virtual environment and get the whole process started.
#### tox

Which brings me to tox.  Tox allows me to test my app across multiple library versions.  When writing Django Resuable Apps, the main libraries you care about are Python and Django, obviously.  If this were a more complex app, I might choose to test against multiple versions of other libraries such as Django Rest Framework.

Installing tox with poetry is very straightforward:

`poetry add --group dev tox="*"`

Note that this installs it as a "dev" dependency which means that poetry will not bundle the tox package when building districution of our app.  

tox is configured with a tox.ini file.  For a start I recommend:

```
[tox]
envlist = py{38,310}-django{32,40,41}
isolated_build = true

[testenv]
allowlist_externals = 
    poetry
deps =
    pytest
commands_pre = 
    poetry install --no-root --sync
commands =
    poetry run pytest ./example-project
```

I will add to this file throughout this document.  And I will write more about tox in the #testing section.

#### pytest

Django comes with its own testing framework.  And it's pretty good.  If you are content with it that's fine.  I like to have a bit more control over my test runners.  And I like the way that pytest uses fixtures.  And I've just gotten used to it over the years.  So I use pytest. 

`poetry add --group dev pytest pytest-django factory-boy`

There are several useful [pytest plugins](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/reference/plugin_list.html) you can add if you like.

I'll write more about pytest in the #testing section.

#### yapf

I use yapf (Yet Another Python Formatter) for linting because I like my code to be pretty.  Install it like this:

`poetry add --group dev yapf`

I _might_ revert to **black** instead of **yapf** simply because it can't be formatted and therefore it's impossible to get into arguments about what the code style should look like.  At the time of writing, though, there are just a few idiosyncracies about **black** that bug me. 

In fact, I'm so idiosyncratic that I add my own personal style choices to yapf:

```
{
  "dedent_closing_brackets": 1,
  "split_all_top_level_comma_separated_values": 1,
}
```

I will revisit these preferences when discussing the IDE.

#### sphinx


I use sphinx for documenting my code.  This will automatically parse docstings in code:

```
class MyClass(object):
  """
  I am a docstring for the class
  """

  def my_function(self, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    I am another docstring for the function
    """
    pass

  
  my_variable = True
  """
  I am yet another docstring for the variable
  (notice how I come after the definition)
  """
  
  pass
```

When I have comments that I don't need to be documented, I use the following syntax:

```
def my_complex_function(*args, **kwargs):
  for i in range(100):
    # this is a complex process that I want to leave a comment about, but I don't need sphinx to parse it
    do_something(i)
```

Install sphinx, and some associated packages that I like, using

`poetry add --group docs sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme myst-parser`

By default sphinx can parse ReStructuredText documents.  `myst-parser` allows it to parse MarkDown (which is not only more intuitive, it is also what GitHub wrote your README file in).  And `sphinx-rtd-theme` incorporates the standard theme used by ReadTheDocs - which is where our documentation is going to wind up (assuming this app is going to be public).

### bootstrap your repository

Recall that we created some empty directories at the root of our repository.  We can now flesh them out with actual content.  I have created templates that can be used to help with this process.  If you don't like my teplates, then just use the standard bootstrapping tools.  If you find my templates too complex, then just copy this repository and change the bits you don't like.

#### bootstrapping the app

This is easy.  Just run

`django-admin startapp --template=https://github.com/allynt/django-reusable-app-template/archive/master.zip singleton2` 

and the "singleton2" directory will be populated with the stubs needed to develop your app. 

This is a pretty standard Django App with the following tweaks:

* "apps.py" tries to register any checks and signals associated w/ the app
* "checks.py" includes some standard checks I run against all my apps; these can be expanded as needed
* "conf.py" includes app-specific configuration using the **django-appconf** reusable app
* "urls.py" includes an empty `urlpatterns` array that will be referenced by the example-project below

#### boostrapping the project to develop against

This is also easy.

`django-admin startproject --template=https://github.com/allynt/django-reusable-app-project-template/archive/master.zip example example-project` 

will populate the "example-project" directory.

When developing a Resuable Django App, there are different approaches to testing and building migrations.  I've come across a lot of apps that just don't document this at all.  I've come across others that have special scripts which *fake* a Django Project (ie: just a minimal "settings.py" file to run `django.setup()` with) to load the app in order to generate migrations.  But I feel like it makes sense to use a *real* Django Project so that you can interact with your app naturally.  

Therefore the "example-project" that I create can be run just like any other Django Project.  It will allow me to generate migrations.  And it will allow me to run tests (located in "example-project/example/tests").  But, crucially, it will also allow me to hack about and make sure I understand exactly how the code works.

I am quite partial to many of the ideas recommended by Cookiecuter Django and so this example-project uses some of their ideas.

* a separate app called "config" where all project-level configurations like "settings.py" and "urls.py" go
* an app called "example" where all the code that will use the Django Resuable App goes - this includes a "tests" module 
* some custom additions to the "settings.py" file, including the use of **django-environ** to read environment variables

#### bootstrapping the documentation

As mentioned above I use sphinx for the documentation.  I have provided a template that tweaks the default documentation structure - including linking the README.md file and autogenerated documentation to the index page.  This template is available at [https://github.com/allynt/django-reusable-app-sphinx-template](https://github.com/allynt/django-reusable-app-sphinx-template).  At the time of writing, the sphinx CLI cannot use a remote template, therefore this repository must first be cloned locally and then the following command

`cd docs && sphinx-quickstart --templatedir=django-reusable-app-sphinx-template/templates .` will create some initial documentation.

### setup a sensible environment (part 2)

An IDE makes life a lot easier.  I use **VSCode**.  I have therefore included a ".vscode/settings.json" file (and a generic ".editorconfig" file) to configure a few nice features.  My configuration includes a path to the virtual environment created by poetry: ".venv" in order to do code-completion as well as linting.  I also specify the custom style arguments to **yapf** mentioned earlier.

In theory, keeping these files with the repository not only makes it easier for *me* to code, it makes it less likely for *you* to push code that conflicts with my style.

> *TODO* Although, I may also add a github action to automatically lint all incoming code.

I also some particularly useful VSCode plugins installed:
* MS Python (this will install loads of other useful plugins)
* Markdown all in one
* Better comments
* Better ToML
* DotENV
* Intellicode
* Tabnine

*Actually, I use a few more plugins for full-stack development, but these are the ones that are relevant for creating Django Resuable Apps.*

### coding

So that is most of the setup required before diving into actual coding.  There are a few other things that are needed to actually run, test, document, publish, etc. the code.

#### connect the app to the example-project

Obviously, we need to tell **example-project** about **django-singleton2**.  This is very straightforward, just add the following to "example-project/config/settings.py":

```
LOCAL_APPS = [
    "singleton2",
    "example",
]
```

If your app is more complex then there will probably be some additional configuration needed, such as adding your views to "example-project/config/urls.py".

You also need to make sure that all of your app's dependencies are installed:

`poetry add django django-appconf django-environ`

Now try running `poetry run ./example-project/manage.py runserver` and see if something appears at "localhost:8000".  If not, you messed up.

#### documentation

In a
#### read the docs

Next I want to see my documentation on readthedocs because I deserve it.  This requires signing up for an account on readthedocs.org via github.  

Then import your github project.  For some strange reason, readthedocs didn't recognise my repository and so I had to import it manually.  There is a very helpful GUI that walks you through the process.

In hindesight, using tox to build documentation is probably a bad idea b/c it pollutes the venvs w/ unused dependencies and I'm not really using it anyway since the integration between github and readthedocs will build it for me.

So, I'm just going to run `poetry shell && make html` in the docs directory whenever I want to see documentation locally.  And use a ".readthedocs.yml" to make sure that all my dependencies (such as django) are installed when readthedocs uses sphinx to build documentation.

So, readthedocs *can* parse the "pyproject.toml" file, but only top-level dependencies.  I therefore added some explicit dependencies for documenation using the "docs" dependency group: `poetry export -f requirments.txt --only docs --output docs/requirements.txt` and referenced it in the ".readthedocs.yml" like this:


```
python:
  install:
    - method: pip
      path: .
      extra_requirements:
        - docs/requirements.txt
```

I don't understand it either.



### testing

there are loads of ways to tweak pytest, I happen to be using pytest-django 
https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/reference/plugin_list.html

#### pytest 

#### tox

Tox allows me to test a matrix of package versions.  The obvious thing to do is to test it against different versions of Python & Django.  To speed things up you can run tox in parallel via `poetry run tox -p all` (although this doesn't provide as much output).

#### github actions

So I want to use poetry to run tox which uses pytest as the runner automatically whenever code is pushed to github.  I do this using github actions and the clever library tox-gh-actions as well as github's publically available [Install Poetry Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-poetry-action)
  
`mkdir -p .github/workflows`

The section in tox.ini maps github action matrices to tox environments.  For example in the workflow file:

```
strategy:
    matrix:
      python-version: ["3.8", "3.10"]
```

defines 2 versions of python and the corresponding section in the tox config file:

```
[gh-actions]
python =
    3.8: py38
    3.10: py310
```

maps those to the existing "py38" and "py310" arguments at the top of the tox config file.
### documentation

I am using tox to generate documentation because *why not*?  I have added a separate section to the "tox.ini" file to deal w/ this.  Now, the [official tox documentation](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/example/documentation.html#sphinx) recommends bypassing the Makefile generated by `sphinx` but I disagree.  Why wouldn't I want to continue using the official approved way of generating documentation?  All I want to do w/ tox is to eventually integrate this into CI.  In order to build documentation run `poetry run tox -e docs`.  Note that I have tell `tox` about the "make" command by adding it to the "allowlist_externals" variable.
### versioning

### package 

### publish

use dev-py
